    text: I am pansexual. Recently, I have also been thinking about maybe experimenting
      with polyamory. I think it's close-minded to think that everyone is looking
      for a monogamous relationship. I think it would be pretty claustrophobic to
      spend the rest of your life with only one person, but I would also prefer to
      be someone's top priority and have them be my top priority.
