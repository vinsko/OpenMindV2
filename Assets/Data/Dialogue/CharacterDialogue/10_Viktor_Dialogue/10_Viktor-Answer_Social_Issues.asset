    text: I think migration. I notice some people of my age that behave themselves
      in a way that is not normal. I have a problem with that. Some population groups,
      probably because of social deprivation, are more concerned with being in the
      thieving guild than actually studying something decent. When countries are
      being attacked and people really need to flee, I think you need to help them.
      That doesn't mean we need to drag them to other countries where they will never
      feel at home.
