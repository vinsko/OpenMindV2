    text: I try to follow as many different news sources as I can to get a clear
      view of what is happening on both the right and left side. Personally, I am
      on the right side of the political spectrum. I will never join a splinter party.
      I also think populism is condemnable, because it is really easy to use people's
      gut feeling. I can't stand Donald Trump because of that.
