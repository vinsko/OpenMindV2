    text: I think it is great that we have different levels, because not everyone
      functions in the same way. That being said, I don't think it's right to consider
      them higher or lower. I think we are too focussed on grading how well someone
      can reproduce something instead of actually understanding and applying it.
      Lastly, the social dynamics of high school are not for me.
