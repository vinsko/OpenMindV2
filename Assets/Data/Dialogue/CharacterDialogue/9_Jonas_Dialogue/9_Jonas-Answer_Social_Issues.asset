    text: I care about the rights of minority groups, such as trans rights to be
      more specific, but also for religious and ethnic minorities. I think I'm passionate
      about social justice in general. Besides that, I think trusting science is
      important. A lot of people are doing their own research and the legitimacy
      from real scientific research is declining because of that.
