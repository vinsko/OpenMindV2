    text: "I love to ride my bike and I read a lot. I\u2019ve actually been reading
      to three Turkish kids and it\u2019s always so much fun. They even call me grandma
      now! They used to not really talk in school, and when they did, it was only
      ever in Turkish, but now they speak Dutch very well. It\u2019s so important
      to me to get out of your social bubble sometimes. "
