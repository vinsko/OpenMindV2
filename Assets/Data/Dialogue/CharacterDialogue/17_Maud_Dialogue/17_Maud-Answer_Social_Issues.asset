    text: I have a strong opinion about so many things. I have a lot of discussions
      about racism, inequality of opportunity and gender inequality. If I have an
      opinion about something, I will not keep my mouth shut! I think everyone should
      be allowed to be themselves and that somebody else should never project their
      own views on them. Share your privileges! You won't be any worse off if others
      gain something.
