    text: I like that it's possible to stack diploma's. Someone that starts at vmbo
      will be able to go to MBO, HBO or even to university eventually. That being
      said, I'm absolutely not a fan of standardized tests. That way, you are not
      testing someone's actual skill. The only thing you are testing is how good
      someone is at reading from a book and remembering the information.
