    text: I'm left wing. In general, I'd rather not participate in political discussions.
      Especially when someone says something important I don't agree with at all.
      I think there are a lot stupid people here that believe anything without thinking
      or looking for the truth. I think a lot of sectors and groups of people are
      going to suffer. I see that we are going to the right side and for things like
      culture, there will be less money.
