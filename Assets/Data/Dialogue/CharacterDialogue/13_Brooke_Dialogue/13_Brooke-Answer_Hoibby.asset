    text: I have too many! Drawing, painting, needlework, making music, lots of volunteering
      and watching cringey tv. I used to be a DJ and I do all kinds of sports. It's
      kind of my pitfall. I enjoy doing all creative things. I can learn new things
      quickly. I don't have one talent, I can do many things a little. I don't understand
      it when people have no hobbies, besides watching Netflix.
