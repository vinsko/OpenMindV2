    text: I'm doing pretty good. This is a weird time in my life. For the first time
      I actually have money, but I don't have enough time to spend it. I have the
      opportunity to do things that I didn't have enough money for in the past, like
      buying a drum kit! If I would only go to work and come home to eat and sleep,
      I would get really sad. So a busy life it is!
