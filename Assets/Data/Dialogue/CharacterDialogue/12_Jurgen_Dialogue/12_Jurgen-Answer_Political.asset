    text: I don't care about big political discussions. By that I mean things outside
      of the local context that I can't influence. I do that consciously. I don't
      watch the news and I often don't vote. If I vote, I need to do a lot of research,
      more than just filling in a voting guide. I read the program points and see
      how it aligns with my vision. I don't think that is done enough, even though
      it's important.
