    text: 'What everyone is talking about right now. Migration, immigrants and the
      asylum seeker problem. I think that, when talking about seeking asylum because
      of danger, I''m entirely open to it. We need people from outside of the Netherlands,
      the economy would collapse otherwise. But when people think the grass is greener
      on the other side of the mountain and contribute nothing to society, I think
      a country like the Netherlands should say: "No, there is no place for you here".
      I speak up about discrimination within the police itself as well. It is not
      a place where you expect it to happen and it shouldn''t be allowed.'
